# Image Recognition
Repository for testing and machine learning with image recognition

Algorithms/programs written by Dr. Rich Huebner


## Data Set - Caltec101

This project uses the Caltec101 image data set, available for download here.

Extract the compressed file into a subfolder called .\images

All of the algorithms depend upon those files being in the .\images subdirectory.

These images are the training set images.

Place your test image into a subdirectory called \testimage

The algorithm will work with any test image you place there, in .jpg format.

## Algorithm 1.  Expectation Maximization.  Filename:   em.R
